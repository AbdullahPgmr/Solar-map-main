        name: "Mercury",
        distanceFromSun: "Closest planet to the Sun, about 57.9 million km",
        size: "Smallest planet in the solar system",
        characteristics: "Has extreme temperature variations due to lack of atmosphere, ranging from very hot to very cold. It has a large iron core and is heavily cratered",
        image: "mercury.jpg",
    },
    {
        name: "Venus",
        distanceFromSun: "Second planet from the Sun, approximately 108 million km",
        size: "Similar in size to Earth",
        characteristics: "Known for its thick, toxic atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide. Surface features include volcanoes and vast plains. It has a very slow rotation and is often called Earth's 'sister planet'",
        image: "venus.jpg",
    },
    {
        name: "Earth",
        distanceFromSun: "Third planet from the Sun, about 150 million km",
        size: "Largest rocky planet, with a diverse surface including oceans and continents",
        characteristics: "Supports life due to its atmosphere (rich in nitrogen and oxygen) and moderate temperatures. It has a magnetic field that protects it from solar winds",
        image: "earth.jpg",
    },
    {
        name: "Mars",
        distanceFromSun: "Fourth planet from the Sun, roughly 228 million km",
        size: "Smaller than Earth, with a thin atmosphere",
        characteristics: "Known as the 'Red Planet' due to its iron oxide-rich surface. Features include the largest volcano (Olympus Mons) and the deepest canyon (Valles Marineris) in the solar system. Evidence suggests Mars once had liquid water on its surface",

        distanceFromSun: "Fifth planet from the Sun, approximately 778 million km",
        size: "Largest planet in the solar system, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium",
        characteristics: "Known for its immense size and strong magnetic field. Jupiter has a turbulent atmosphere with the Great Red Spot, a persistent storm larger than Earth. It has a ring system and over 70 known moons, including the largest moon Ganymede",
        image: "jupiter.jpg",

        distanceFromSun: "Sixth planet from the Sun, about 1.4 billion km",
        size: "Second largest planet, also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium",
        characteristics: "Recognized for its extensive ring system made of ice and dust particles. Saturn has a complex atmosphere with distinctive cloud patterns and a hexagonal polar vortex. It has over 80 moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere and lakes of liquid methane",
        image: "saturn.jpg",

        name: "Uranus",
        distanceFromSun: "Seventh planet from the Sun, roughly 2.9 billion km",
        size: "Smaller than Jupiter and Saturn but larger than Neptune",
        characteristics: "Has a unique rotational axis tilted almost 90 degrees relative to its orbit (resulting in extreme seasonal variations). Uranus is composed mostly of ice and rock, with a faint ring system and a set of 13 known rings. It has a set of 27 known moons",
        image: "uranus.jpg",
    },
    {
        name: "Neptune",
        distanceFromSun: "Eighth planet from the Sun, about 4.5 billion km",
        size: "Similar in size to Uranus",
        characteristics: "Known for its vivid blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. Neptune has strong winds, including the fastest recorded in the solar system. It has a faint ring system and 14 known moons, including Triton, which orbits in the opposite direction to the planet's rotation",
